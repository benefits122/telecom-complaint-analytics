## Methodology

### 1. Category Weight
Numeric weights are assigned to each complaint type to reflect operational importance:

| Category | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| Network Outage | 5 |
| Call Drop | 4 |
| Slow Internet | 3 |
| Billing Issue | 2 |
| Customer Service | 1 |

**Airtable formula:**
```markdown
SWITCH(
  {Category},
  "Network Outage", 5,
  "Call Drop", 4,
  "Slow Internet", 3,
  "Billing Issue", 2,
  "Customer Service", 1
)

## Severity Score
Calculates complaint severity based on Resolution Time, Category Weight, and Satisfaction

(0.4 * {Resolution Time (Days)}) +
(0.4 * {Category Weight}) +
(0.2 * (6 - {Satisfaction (1–5)}))

## Risk Level
Classifies complaints as Low, Medium, or High based on Severity Score

IF(
  {Severity Score} >= 7, "High",
  IF(
    {Severity Score} >= 4, "Medium",
    "Low"
  )
)
